# a11y-presentation

This repo contains a simple HTML page with some common accessibility issues to go along with my accessibility presentation. It is meant to illustrate the following problems:
* Insufficient color contrast
* Missing/improper image alt text
* Missing/improper heading structure
* Lack of keyboard operability
* Missing form labels

There is also a pair of files (HTML and CSS) that illustrate potential solutions to the above accessibility issues.
